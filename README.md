Statistics is the science of reasoning from data, heavily reliant on mathematical concepts, particularly probability, to analyze random phenomena. 
Introduces both probability and statistical concepts, essential for understanding statistics, covering topics such as exploratory data analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics, with a focus on classical and bootstrapping/randomization approaches. 
Applied concepts and skills to new problems, effectively communicating statistical ideas, and interpreting various statistical techniques. 
Grasped fundamental ideas such as variability, distribution, and sampling, and utilize simulation-based inference methods. 
Analyzed statistical arguments, conduct descriptive analyses, distinguish between observational studies and controlled experiments, and interpret different types of distributions while understanding the limitations of statistical inference concepts like confidence and significance.
